\frametitle{The editor}
Texworks is a flexible editor that I have used on the Windows platform. It gives me the opportunity to create more complex document, although creating the first might take some time to get used to.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The basics}
I learned the basics of LaTeX:starting a document, creating a title and author. Later on I was able to create headers, section, using layout styles, numbering the pages and creating a table of contents page.

\frametitle{Images}
I now know how to use images in my \LaTeX documents. With the help of the pdf packages, I can easily type in "includegraphics" and specify the filename and size.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{References}
 I have used Bibtex to show references. I am able to cite the sources from a source. Furthermore, I have learned how to simple cite from pages that support bibtex.

\frametitle{Will I ever use Latex again in the future?}
 Yes, I do plan on getting more familiar with Latex, because the possibilites with it are amazing. Moreover, using Latex takes a more professional approach for documenting.
